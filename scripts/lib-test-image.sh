# Sourced by scripts/test.sh and scripts/test-ui.sh. Builds a test image so that each run leaves no orphan behind.
#
# Every build re-points a tag and orphans the image it pointed to (a "dangling" image: a few hundred MB of layers per
# source change, for ever). So the tag is per work tree (this checkout's path), not shared by all of them, the image
# carries a label with the same key, and after a successful build the work tree's previous images are removed.
# Only images with this work tree's label are touched, so a build in another work tree running at the same time is
# never affected. An image still used by a container refuses to go ("in use"): that error is ignored. Layers shared with
# the new image stay, so the layer cache works as before.
#
# build_test_image <name> <root> <dockerfile> [extra build args...]  sets $built to the new image id.
