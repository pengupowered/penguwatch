"""Request guards for a LAN-exposed app that has no user accounts.

Threats this addresses:

* **CSRF** - any web page the user opens could POST to http://<pc>:<port>/api/... because the API has no
  auth and no Origin check. Browsers always send `Origin` on cross-site POSTs, so a same-origin rule on
  state-changing requests stops that without any UI change.
* **DNS rebinding** - an attacker domain that re-resolves to the LAN IP passes a same-origin check, so the
  `Host` header is validated too (IP literals, localhost, single-label and .local names by default; extra
  names via <PREFIX>_ALLOWED_HOSTS).
* **Unauthenticated LAN access** - optional shared access token (<PREFIX>_ACCESS_TOKEN), sent as a Bearer
  header or an HttpOnly session cookie obtained from /login. Websockets are checked the same way.
* **Copied or forgotten sign-ins** - the session cookie carries a signed issue time: the server refuses it after
  <PREFIX>_SESSION_MAX_AGE_DAYS (default 30) and whenever the token changes. With a `SessionStore` from the app,
  POST /logout refuses that cookie from then on, and POST /logout?everywhere=1 every cookie issued until then.
  Without one, POST /logout only clears the cookie of the browser that sends it.
* **Oversized bodies** and **abuse of expensive endpoints** (`rate_limit`).

Everything that differs between apps lives in an `AppProfile`; an app declares one and subclasses
`SecurityConfig` to attach it. No third-party dependencies beyond FastAPI/Starlette.

    * Read again whenever the file changes (one stat per check), so several worker processes agree. A missing file
      means nobody signed out yet. A file that cannot be read or parsed refuses the cookie being checked (fails
      closed) and is tried again on the next check; a broken file keeps refusing every cookie until it is fixed or
      deleted, or someone signed in with the Bearer token signs out everywhere (which rewrites it).
    * Every change is a read-modify-replace under an exclusive `flock` on `<file>.lock` next to it, so two processes
      cannot lose each other's sign-outs. Where `fcntl` does not exist (Windows), there is no such lock: it works,
      but run one process (a sign-out made at the same moment in another process could be lost); it logs this once.
    * A single sign-out is kept until its cookie would have expired anyway (issue time + maximum age + 5 minutes).
      The file records the shortest maximum age those times were computed with; when the configured one is later
      longer, a forgotten sign-out could come back, so everyone is signed out once instead. Past `max_revoked` entries (sign-
      outs within one maximum age), a sign-out signs out everyone instead, so the file stays small.
